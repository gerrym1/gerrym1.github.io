	<h4>Hi, ladies and gentlemen, this is Gerry Moriarty with some current information on the real estate market.
As always, we’re going to give you some news and we’re going to give you the updates.
The news is pretty positive and I want to make sure that everyone realizes that because there are
some mass-media sources that are trying to convey a situation where maybe the economy is not
doing as well or that the housing market is struggling right now with affordability. We do have
some challenges. The challenges are inventory, but I want to make sure that you know how to
counter some of those false narratives that are out there right now. So, let’s jump right into the
news.
First off, a quote from MarketWatch, “Consumer confidence rose in July to the second highest
level in 16 years as Americans shrugged off all the drama in Washington and
took heart in the best labor market in a decade.” Again, some of the drama that
people are getting distracted with, all right, and media is getting distracted with the American
people are not. They understand they’re in a better position as far as their job is concerned. The
MarketWatch quote goes on to say, “The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index
rose to 121.1 this month from 117.3 in June. The increase exceeded the 116.9 forecast of
economists polled by MarketWatch.”
So, make sure that you catch what’s being said there. The economists that they polled prior to
the number coming out thought that consumer confidence was going to drop and instead it
increased to the second highest level in 16 years. So, though there are some people, mostly in
the media, that are spinning one narrative what’s actually happening to the American people is
they’re feeling confident and they’re out there doing things. And probably the best
indicator of that is the second quarter homeownership rate report that came out from the census.
For the first time this decade the homeownership rate actually went up. It was almost in a free
dive. Some people thought that it was going to hit 50 percent, but as you can see, the second
quarter of 2016 last year was at 62.9 and now, it jumped up to 63.7, the highest level in three
years.
So, things are changing in the economy and things are changing in housing right now where
more and more people are jumping, as a percentage, are jumping into home ownership. As a
matter of fact, Ivy Zelman in her latest Z Report said this, “On a seasonally adjusted basis, the
homeownership rate averaged 63.8 in the first half of 2017. If that holds through the remainder
of the year, which we believe is likely 2017 will stand higher than both 2016 and 2015.” 
So, what Ivy Zelman is projecting is that the homeownership rate at the end of this year is going
to be higher than it’s been in three years.
So, again ladies and gentlemen, people are jumping back in as far as purchasing a home is
concerned and David H. Stevens, the Mortgage Bankers Association President and CEO said this,
“The bottom line is that the economy is strong and improving. Interest rates remain low and
employment is high, which when combined with the coming demographic shift as more
millennials enter prime household-creating years, suggest the housing market is on a steady
course for the foreseeable future.” That's why there are so many buyers in
the market. That’s why demand is so high.
